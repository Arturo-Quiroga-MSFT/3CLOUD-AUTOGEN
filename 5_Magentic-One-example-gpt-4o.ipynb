    "## Magentic One Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Magentic-One is a generalist multi-agent system for solving open-ended web and file-based tasks across a variety of domains. It represents a significant step forward for multi-agent systems, achieving competitive performance on a number of agentic benchmarks (see the technical report for full details).\n",
    "\n",
    "When originally released in November 2024 Magentic-One was implemented directly on the autogen-core library. We have now ported Magentic-One to use autogen-agentchat, providing a more modular and easier to use interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using Magentic-One involves interacting with a digital world designed for humans, which carries inherent risks. To minimize these risks, consider the following precautions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use Containers: Run all tasks in docker containers to isolate the agents and prevent direct system attacks.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Virtual Environment: Use a virtual environment to run the agents and prevent them from accessing sensitive data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Monitor Logs: Closely monitor logs during and after execution to detect and mitigate risky behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Human Oversight: Run the examples with a human in the loop to supervise the agents and prevent unintended consequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Limit Access: Restrict the agents’ access to the internet and other resources to prevent unauthorized actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Safeguard Data: Ensure that the agents do not have access to sensitive data or resources that could be compromised. Do not share sensitive information with the agents. Be aware that agents may occasionally attempt risky actions, such as recruiting humans for help or accepting cookie agreements without human involvement. Always ensure agents are monitored and operate within a controlled environment to prevent unintended consequences. Moreover, be cautious that Magentic-One may be susceptible to prompt injection attacks from webpages."

      "- No specific facts or figures are directly provided in the request itself.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2. FACTS TO LOOK UP\n",
      "- The current UV index in Toronto today.\n",
      "- The UV index can typically be found on authoritative weather-related sources such as:\n",
      "  - Environment Canada\n",
      "  - The Weather Network\n",
      "  - AccuWeather\n",
      "  - World Meteorological Organization (WMO)\n",
      "\n",
      "### 3. FACTS TO DERIVE\n",
      "- The UV index for Toronto could potentially be derived if certain variables (e.g., time, weather conditions, cloud coverage, ozone levels) are known and combined with a UV exposure model. However, this is unlikely necessary if reliable data can be retrieved directly.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 4. EDUCATED GUESSES\n",
      "- The UV index in Toronto tends to be higher during clear, sunny days and lower during overcast or rainy conditions.\n",
      "- In autumn or winter months, the UV index is generally lower due to the reduced intensity of sunlight and shorter days.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Here is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Step 1**: Ask WebSurfer to perform a web search for the current UV index in Toronto today using reliable sources such as Environment Canada, The Weather Network, or AccuWeather.  \n",
      "- **Step 2**: Have WebSurfer summarize the relevant page or extract the UV index value specifically.  \n",
      "- **Step 3**: Verify that the information provided is current and matches today's date.  \n",
      "- **Step 4**: Provide the UV index value to the user along with the source for transparency.  \n",

      "\n",
      "FileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\n",
      "WebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n",
      "Coder: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\n",
      "ComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Here is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n",
      "\n",
      "### 1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\n",
      "- A Python script is requested.\n",
      "- The script's purpose is to fetch data from the OpenWeatherMap API.\n",
      "- The script must save the fetched data locally.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2. FACTS TO LOOK UP\n",
      "- The specific OpenWeatherMap API endpoint to use for fetching data (e.g., current weather, forecast, etc.).\n",
      "- The format of the data returned by the API (e.g., JSON, XML).\n",
      "- Whether authentication is required, and if so, the process for obtaining an API key (likely found on the OpenWeatherMap official documentation).\n",
      "- The recommended method for saving the data locally (e.g., file format: JSON, CSV, or plain text).\n",
      "\n",
      "### 3. FACTS TO DERIVE\n",
      "- The structure of the Python script, including:\n",
      "  - Necessary libraries for API requests (e.g., `requests` module).\n",
      "  - Libraries for handling and saving data locally (e.g., `json`, `os`, etc.).\n",
      "- Error handling and logging mechanisms for API failures or file-saving issues.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 4. EDUCATED GUESSES\n",
      "- The OpenWeatherMap API likely requires an API key for authentication, based on standard practices for similar services.\n",
      "- The data returned from OpenWeatherMap is probably in JSON format, as this is common for modern APIs.\n",
      "- File-saving could involve naming conventions (e.g., timestamp-based filenames) to prevent overwriting existing data.\n",
      "- The script might need to handle rate limits imposed by the OpenWeatherMap API.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Here is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n",
      "\n",
      "### Plan for Addressing the Request\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **WebSurfer**:\n",
      "   - Search for the OpenWeatherMap API documentation to find:\n",
      "     - The correct API endpoint for fetching weather data.\n",
      "     - Authentication requirements (e.g., how to obtain an API key).\n",
      "     - Data format (likely JSON) and any specific parameters required for the API request.\n",
      "     - Rate limits or other restrictions.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Coder**:\n",
      "   - Write the Python script based on the information retrieved by WebSurfer:\n",
      "     - Include functionality for sending requests to the OpenWeatherMap API.\n",
      "     - Parse the returned data (likely JSON).\n",
      "     - Save the data locally in a suitable format (e.g., JSON file).\n",
      "     - Implement error handling for API failures, rate limits, or file-writing issues.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **FileSurfer**:\n",
      "   - Verify that the file is saved locally as expected (e.g., check file existence and file content structure).\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **ComputerTerminal**:\n",
      "   - Run the Python script to ensure it works as intended:\n",
      "     - Test the script for fetching data from the API and saving it locally.\n",
      "     - Confirm no runtime errors or issues.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Final Validation**:\n",
      "   - Ensure the saved file can be opened and read properly.\n",
      "   - Confirm that the data fetched matches the expected output from the OpenWeatherMap API.\n",
      "\n",

Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page.

GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\\n- A Python script is requested.\\n- The script's purpose is to fetch data from the OpenWeatherMap API.\\n- The script must save the fetched data locally.\\n\\n### 2. FACTS TO LOOK UP\\n- The specific OpenWeatherMap API endpoint to use for fetching data (e.g., current weather, forecast, etc.).\\n- The format of the data returned by the API (e.g., JSON, XML).\\n- Whether authentication is required, and if so, the process for obtaining an API key (likely found on the OpenWeatherMap official documentation).\\n- The recommended method for saving the data locally (e.g., file format: JSON, CSV, or plain text).\\n\\n### 3. FACTS TO DERIVE\\n- The structure of the Python script, including:\\n  - Necessary libraries for API requests (e.g., `requests` module).\\n  - Libraries for handling and saving data locally (e.g., `json`, `os`, etc.).\\n- Error handling and logging mechanisms for API failures or file-saving issues.\\n\\n### 4. EDUCATED GUESSES\\n- The OpenWeatherMap API likely requires an API key for authentication, based on standard practices for similar services.\\n- The data returned from OpenWeatherMap is probably in JSON format, as this is common for modern APIs.\\n- File-saving could involve naming conventions (e.g., timestamp-based filenames) to prevent overwriting existing data.\\n- The script might need to handle rate limits imposed by the OpenWeatherMap API.\\n\\n\\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\\n\\n### Plan for Addressing the Request\\n\\n1. **WebSurfer**:\\n   - Search for the OpenWeatherMap API documentation to find:\\n     - The correct API endpoint for fetching weather data.\\n     - Authentication requirements (e.g., how to obtain an API key).\\n     - Data format (likely JSON) and any specific parameters required for the API request.\\n     - Rate limits or other restrictions.\\n\\n2. **Coder**:\\n   - Write the Python script based on the information retrieved by WebSurfer:\\n     - Include functionality for sending requests to the OpenWeatherMap API.\\n     - Parse the returned data (likely JSON).\\n     - Save the data locally in a suitable format (e.g., JSON file).\\n     - Implement error handling for API failures, rate limits, or file-writing issues.\\n\\n3. **FileSurfer**:\\n   - Verify that the file is saved locally as expected (e.g., check file existence and file content structure).\\n\\n4. **ComputerTerminal**:\\n   - Run the Python script to ensure it works as intended:\\n     - Test the script for fetching data from the API and saving it locally.\\n     - Confirm no runtime errors or issues.\\n\\n5. **Final Validation**:\\n   - Ensure the saved file can be opened and read properly.\\n   - Confirm that the data fetched matches the expected output from the OpenWeatherMap API.\\n\", type='TextMessage'), TextMessage(source='MagenticOneOrchestrator', models_usage=None, metadata={}, content='Search for the OpenWeatherMap API documentation and find details about the API endpoint, authentication process, data format, and any limitations (e.g., rate limits).', type='TextMessage'), MultiModalMessage(source='WebSurfer', models_usage=RequestUsage(prompt_tokens=3036, completion_tokens=44), metadata={}, content=['I typed \\'OpenWeatherMap API documentation\\' into \\'0 characters out of 2000\\'.\\n\\nThe web browser is open to the page [OpenWeatherMap API documentation - Search](https://www.bing.com/search?q=OpenWeatherMap+API+documentation&form=QBLH&sp=-1&lq=0&pq=&sc=0-0&qs=n&sk=&cvid=D52D64F1205C4A64963329FBE80C2675).\\nThe viewport shows 24% of the webpage, and is positioned at the top of the page\\nThe following text is visible in the viewport:\\n\\nBy using this site you agree to the use of cookies for analytics, personalized content, and ads.\\nLearn more about third party cookies\\n|\\nMicrosoft Privacy Policy \\nSkip to content\\nOpenWeatherMap API documentationFrançaisMobileAll\\nSearch\\nVideos\\nImages\\nMaps\\nNews\\nCopilot\\nMore\\nTools\\nCopilot Answer\\nOpenWeatherMap\\nhttps://\\nopenweathermap.org/\\napiWeather API - OpenWeatherMap\\nLearn how to use\\n OpenWeatherMap APIs to access current, forecast, historical, and statistical weather data for any location on the globe.
