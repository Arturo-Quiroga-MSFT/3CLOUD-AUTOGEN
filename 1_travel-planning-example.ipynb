      "1. **Official Language:** Nepali is the official language of Nepal. English is widely spoken in tourist areas like Kathmandu, Pokhara, and Thamel, but it may be less common in rural areas.\n",
      "   \n",
      "2. **Key Phrases in Nepali:**\n",
      "   - **Namaste** (नमस्ते): Hello/Greetings.\n",
      "   - **Dhanyabad** (धन्यवाद): Thank you.\n",
      "   - **Maaf garnu hos** (माफ गर्नुहोस्): Excuse me/Sorry.\n",
      "   - **Kati ho?** (कति हो?): How much?\n",
      "   - **Ho** (हो): Yes and **Hoina** (होइन): No.\n",
      "   - **Pani cha?** (पानी छ?): Do you have water?\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Translation Apps:** Consider downloading a language translation app like Google Translate for quick assistance. You can also download the Nepali language pack for offline use.\n",

      "\n",
      "5. **Menus and Signs:** In tourist hubs, menus and signs are often bilingual (Nepali and English). However, in more remote areas, you may encounter only Nepali text. Asking locals politely for assistance usually works well.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Hiring Guides:** For places like Bhaktapur or Nagarkot, consider hiring a local guide who speaks English. This will enhance your understanding of the culture, history, and significance of the sites.\n",
