      "1. **Core Features:**\n",
      "   - **Core API**: Implements messaging, event-driven agents, and distributed runtime supporting Python and .NET.\n",
      "   - **AgentChat API**: Specifically for rapid prototyping with common multi-agent configurations like two-agent or group chats.\n",
      "   - **Extensions API**: Adds capabilities like LLM clients (e.g., OpenAI, Azure services), code execution, and third-party extensions【4:1†source】【4:3†source】【4:4†source】.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Developer Tools:**\n",
      "   - **AutoGen Studio**: A no-code graphical user interface (GUI) for creating multi-agent applications.\n",
      "   - **AutoGen Bench**: Benchmarks agent performance【4:1†source】【4:3†source】.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Multi-Agent Applications:** \n",
      "   - Enables complex scenarios such as web browsing, code execution, and automated workflows through collaboration between agents【4:1†source】【4:3†source】【4:4†source】.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Community Support:** \n",
      "   - Offers office hours, tutorials, Q&A through GitHub discussions, Discord, and blogs【4:1†source】.\n",
      "\n",
      "This framework is compatible with Python versions 3.10 and later, allowing developers to integrate LLM models efficiently, including OpenAI's GPT models【4:5†source】【4:6†source】.\n",
