    "## Magentic One Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Magentic-One is a generalist multi-agent system for solving open-ended web and file-based tasks across a variety of domains. It represents a significant step forward for multi-agent systems, achieving competitive performance on a number of agentic benchmarks (see the technical report for full details).\n",
    "\n",
    "When originally released in November 2024 Magentic-One was implemented directly on the autogen-core library. We have now ported Magentic-One to use autogen-agentchat, providing a more modular and easier to use interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using Magentic-One involves interacting with a digital world designed for humans, which carries inherent risks. To minimize these risks, consider the following precautions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use Containers: Run all tasks in docker containers to isolate the agents and prevent direct system attacks.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Virtual Environment: Use a virtual environment to run the agents and prevent them from accessing sensitive data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Monitor Logs: Closely monitor logs during and after execution to detect and mitigate risky behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Human Oversight: Run the examples with a human in the loop to supervise the agents and prevent unintended consequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Limit Access: Restrict the agentsâ€™ access to the internet and other resources to prevent unauthorized actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Safeguard Data: Ensure that the agents do not have access to sensitive data or resources that could be compromised. Do not share sensitive information with the agents. Be aware that agents may occasionally attempt risky actions, such as recruiting humans for help or accepting cookie agreements without human involvement. Always ensure agents are monitored and operate within a controlled environment to prevent unintended consequences. Moreover, be cautious that Magentic-One may be susceptible to prompt injection attacks from webpages."

      "\n",
      "### 4. EDUCATED GUESSES\n",
      "- Melbourne, being in Australia, typically experiences high UV indexes during its sunny seasons due to its geographic location and proximity to the ozone hole over Antarctica.\n",
      "- If the request is made during Australian summer (December-February), the UV index is likely to be high, potentially above 7 or 8.\n",

      "- **Step 1**: Assign **WebSurfer** to search for the current UV index in Melbourne today, using authoritative meteorological sources such as the Australian Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) or other reliable weather websites.\n",
      "- **Step 2**: Confirm that the information is up-to-date and specific to today's date.\n",
