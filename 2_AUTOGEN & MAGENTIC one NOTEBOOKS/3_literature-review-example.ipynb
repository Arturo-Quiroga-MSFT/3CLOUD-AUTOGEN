      "write a detailed summary of the reasons for the recent increase in the sea level rise\n",
      "---------- TextMessage (Google_Search_Agent) ----------\n",
      "Several interconnected processes—driven ultimately by the warming of Earth’s climate—have combined over the past few decades to accelerate the rate at which global mean sea level is rising.  Below is a detailed breakdown of the principal factors:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Thermal Expansion (“Steric Rise”)  \n",
      "   • As the ocean warms, water expands. Even a small temperature increase in the upper several hundred meters translates into a measurable rise in volume.  \n",
      "   • Over the late 20th and early 21st centuries, thermal expansion has contributed roughly 30–50 percent of observed sea‑level rise.  \n",
      "   • The largest warming has occurred in the upper 700 m of the ocean, where most heat uptake from greenhouse‑gas forcing is stored.  \n",
      "\n",
      "2. Melting of Land Ice  \n",
      "   A. Glaciers and Ice Caps (outside Greenland and Antarctica)  \n",
      "     – Small glaciers worldwide (the Alps, Himalayas, Andes, Alaska, etc.) have been losing mass at rates that, aggregated, contribute about 20–25 percent of the current rise.  \n",
      "     – These glaciers respond quickly to regional temperature and precipitation changes.  \n",
      "   B. Greenland Ice Sheet  \n",
      "     – Surface melting and enhanced iceberg calving have accelerated since the 1990s.  \n",
      "     – Today Greenland is the single largest land‑ice source, contributing roughly 15–20 percent of modern sea‑level rise.  \n",
      "   C. Antarctic Ice Sheet  \n",
      "     – West Antarctica in particular has shown increased ice‑stream flow and calving, especially in the Amundsen Sea sector.  \n",
      "     – Overall, Antarctica contributes about 5–10 percent of current rates, but uncertainty remains higher than for Greenland.  \n",
      "\n",
      "3. Changes in Terrestrial Water Storage  \n",
      "   • Human activities—groundwater pumping, reservoir impoundment, deforestation, and large‑scale irrigation—alter how much water is held on land versus discharged to the ocean.  \n",
      "   • In net, groundwater extraction and reservoir filling have added roughly 0.5 mm/yr to sea level in recent decades (though there is some regional and methodological uncertainty).  \n",
      "\n",
      "4. Ice‑Sheet Dynamics and Feedbacks  \n",
      "   • Warming oceans melt ice shelves from below, reducing “buttressing” of land‑based ice and speeding up glacier flow.  \n",
      "   • Surface darkening from meltwater ponds and exposed rock increases absorption of solar radiation, amplifying melt.  \n",
      "\n",
      "5. Gravitational and Land‑Motion Effects (Regional Variations)  \n",
      "   • Large ice masses exert a gravitational pull on surrounding ocean. As they shrink, local sea levels can actually fall near the ice but rise more steeply far away.  \n",
      "   • Glacial‐isostatic adjustment—Earth’s slow rebound from the last Ice Age—modulates regional sea levels.  \n",
      "\n",
      "6. Acceleration of the Rate  \n",
      "   • Over the 20th century, average global sea‑level rose about 1.5–1.7 mm per year. Satellite altimetry since the early 1990s shows rates accelerating to roughly 3.2 mm per year (and locally more than 10 mm per year in some places).  \n",
      "   • Continued greenhouse‑gas emissions, improving ice‑sheet models, and observations all point to further acceleration through this century.  \n",
      "\n",
      "In sum, the recent uptick in sea‐level rise is not the result of a single process but the cumulative effect of warming‐driven ocean expansion, widespread loss of land‐based ice, and human‐altered water storage—augmented by complex feedbacks in ice dynamics and Earth’s crustal adjustments. If global temperatures continue to climb, the pace of sea‐level rise is expected to increase further, posing significant challenges for coastal communities worldwide.\n",

      "Literature Review: Drivers of Recent Sea‑Level Rise\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Introduction  \n",
      "Global mean sea level (GMSL) has risen at an accelerating rate over the past century, from roughly 1.5 ± 0.2 mm yr⁻¹ during 1901–1990 to about 3.3 ± 0.3 mm yr⁻¹ since the early 1990s (IPCC, 2021). This acceleration reflects the combined influence of thermal expansion, land‑ice melt, changing terrestrial water storage, and dynamic ice‑sheet processes. Understanding these contributions is essential for projecting future rise and guiding adaptation.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Ocean Thermal Expansion (“Steric” Component)  \n",
      "As greenhouse‑gas forcing increases ocean heat content, seawater warms and expands, contributing approximately 30–50 % of observed GMSL rise over the late twentieth and early twenty‑first centuries (IPCC, 2021). The upper 700 m of the ocean has absorbed most excess heat, driving a steric sea‑level rise estimated at 1.1 ± 0.2 mm yr⁻¹ since 1970 (IPCC, 2021).\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Mass Loss from Glaciers and Ice Caps  \n",
      "Small to mid‑latitude glaciers worldwide (e.g., the Alps, Himalayas, and Andes) have exhibited negative mass balances since the 1990s. Aggregated glacier contributions to GMSL amount to ~0.8 ± 0.1 mm yr⁻¹ during 2006–2018 (IPCC, 2021). These glaciers respond rapidly to regional temperature and precipitation anomalies, making them sensitive indicators of climate variability.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Greenland and Antarctic Ice‐Sheet Dynamics  \n",
      "4.1 Greenland Ice Sheet  \n",
      "Surface melting and ice‑discharge from Greenland accelerated markedly after 1995, with present contributions of ~0.7 ± 0.1 mm yr⁻¹ to GMSL (IPCC, 2021). Enhanced hydrofracture and englacial drainage—driven by supraglacial lake formation—lubricate the bed and increase outlet glacier speeds (Hageman et al., 2024).  \n",

      "4.2 Antarctic Ice Sheet  \n",
      "The Antarctic contribution (~0.3 ± 0.1 mm yr⁻¹ since 1992) is dominated by West Antarctic ice‑stream acceleration in the Amundsen Sea sector (Rignot et al., 2019). Basal melting of floating ice shelves by warm circumpolar deep water reduces buttressing, promoting dynamic thinning and calving (O’Leary & Christoffersen, 2012).\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Frontal Melting and Calving Amplification  \n",
      "O’Leary and Christoffersen (2012) used finite‑element stress modeling to show that submarine frontal melting can amplify calving rates by a factor of up to 10 relative to surface melt alone. Undercutting of tidewater glacier fronts, especially near the base, increases tensile stresses and preconditions ice for fracture.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. Thermo‑Hydro‑Mechanical Controls on Rapid Discharge  \n",
      "Hageman et al. (2024) developed a coupled thermo‑hydro‑mechanical model demonstrating that viscous deformation of ice governs hydrofracture propagation during rapid supraglacial lake drainage. Their results imply that warm Greenland surface temperatures will exacerbate episodic drainage events, further accelerating mass loss.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. Ice‑Thickness Inference and Model Integration  \n",
      "Guan et al. (2016) introduced a hierarchical Bayesian framework combining glacier dynamics with multiple surface datasets to infer ice‑thickness distributions in West Antarctica. By constraining basal friction and rheology, their approach enhances projections of future ice‑sheet contributions to sea‑level.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. Terrestrial Water Storage Changes  \n",
      "Anthropogenic groundwater pumping, reservoir impoundment, and land‑cover changes have altered continental water storage, contributing a net +0.1 to +0.3 mm yr⁻¹ to GMSL since 1961 (Wada et al., 2016). While smaller than ice‑sheet and steric terms, these fluxes remain an important human‑induced component.\n",
      "\n",
      "9. Regional Variability and Gravitational Effects  \n",
      "Mass loss from large ice bodies reduces local gravitational attraction, causing relative sea‑level fall near the source and amplified rise at distances of thousands of kilometers (Mitrovica et al., 2001). Glacial isostatic adjustment further modulates regional patterns of sea‑level change.\n",
      "\n",
      "10. Conclusion and Future Outlook  \n",
      "The recent acceleration in sea‑level rise results from synergistic warming‑driven processes: ocean warming, ice‑mass loss across scales, and human‑altered water storage—augmented by nonlinear ice dynamics and crustal adjustments. Improved modeling of hydrofracture (Hageman et al., 2024), frontal melt‑calving feedbacks (O’Leary & Christoffersen, 2012), and ice‑sheet basal conditions (Guan et al., 2016) will refine projections. Under high‑emission scenarios, GMSL is projected to rise by 0.6–1.1 m by 2100 (IPCC, 2021), underscoring the urgency of mitigation and coastal adaptation.\n",
