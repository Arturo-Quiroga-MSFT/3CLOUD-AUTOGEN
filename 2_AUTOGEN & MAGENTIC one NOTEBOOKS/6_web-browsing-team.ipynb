      "- The request asks for information about the teams playing in these games.\n",

      "- The NHL schedule for \"today\" (specific date unknown, but it would correspond to the current day).\n",
      "  - Source: The official NHL website (nhl.com) or an authoritative sports schedule source such as ESPN, Sportsnet, or TSN.\n",
      "- Information about the teams playing, including their current statistics, rosters, standings, or notable details.\n",
      "  - Sources: Team profiles on nhl.com, team-specific pages, or league standings.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 3. FACTS TO DERIVE\n",
      "- Logical grouping or matchup context (e.g., whether teams are division rivals or playoff contenders).\n",
      "- Insights into trends or notable streaks—what the matchup dynamics might be based on recent performance.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 4. EDUCATED GUESSES\n",
      "- Today is likely in the middle of the NHL's regular season or playoff season, assuming the league calendar is progressing normally (October through April regular season; playoffs in April through June). Specific matchups could be influenced by divisional alignment and ongoing standings.\n",

      "- **Step 2:** Gather information about each team playing today, including their current standings, notable player performances, recent game outcomes, or relevant team statistics. This information can also be gathered from reputable NHL sources.\n",
      "- **Step 3:** Summarize the schedule and team details in a concise and informative format for the user, providing relevant context or insights into the matchups.\n",
