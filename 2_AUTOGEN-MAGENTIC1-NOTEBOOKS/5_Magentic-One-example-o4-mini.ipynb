    "## Magentic One Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Magentic-One is a generalist multi-agent system for solving open-ended web and file-based tasks across a variety of domains. It represents a significant step forward for multi-agent systems, achieving competitive performance on a number of agentic benchmarks (see the technical report for full details).\n",
    "\n",
    "When originally released in November 2024 Magentic-One was implemented directly on the autogen-core library. We have now ported Magentic-One to use autogen-agentchat, providing a more modular and easier to use interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using Magentic-One involves interacting with a digital world designed for humans, which carries inherent risks. To minimize these risks, consider the following precautions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use Containers: Run all tasks in docker containers to isolate the agents and prevent direct system attacks.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Virtual Environment: Use a virtual environment to run the agents and prevent them from accessing sensitive data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Monitor Logs: Closely monitor logs during and after execution to detect and mitigate risky behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Human Oversight: Run the examples with a human in the loop to supervise the agents and prevent unintended consequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Limit Access: Restrict the agents’ access to the internet and other resources to prevent unauthorized actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Safeguard Data: Ensure that the agents do not have access to sensitive data or resources that could be compromised. Do not share sensitive information with the agents. Be aware that agents may occasionally attempt risky actions, such as recruiting humans for help or accepting cookie agreements without human involvement. Always ensure agents are monitored and operate within a controlled environment to prevent unintended consequences. Moreover, be cautious that Magentic-One may be susceptible to prompt injection attacks from webpages."

      "- The request is asking for today’s UV index in Melbourne.  \n",
      "- “Melbourne” refers to the city in the state of Victoria, Australia.  \n",
      "- The metric sought is the UV index, a standard measure of ultraviolet radiation.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. FACTS TO LOOK UP  \n",
      "- The current date and time (to define “today”).  \n",
      "- Today’s UV index value for Melbourne, as reported by an authoritative meteorological source such as:  \n",
      "  • The Australian Bureau of Meteorology (bom.gov.au)  \n",
      "  • The World Meteorological Organization (public.wmo.int)  \n",
      "  • A reputable weather service (e.g., Weather.com, AccuWeather, or a local news outlet).\n",
      "\n",
      "3. FACTS TO DERIVE  \n",
      "- None strictly required: the UV index is a directly measured/reported value rather than something computed from other data in this context.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. EDUCATED GUESSES  \n",
      "- Depending on the season, Melbourne’s midday UV index can range widely:  \n",
      "  • Summer peak (Dec–Feb): often 10–13  \n",
      "  • Autumn/Spring peak (Mar–Apr, Sep–Nov): roughly 6–9  \n",
      "  • Winter peak (Jun–Aug): around 2–4  \n",
      "- If today is late October on a clear day, an educated guess for the UV index at solar noon might be in the 9–11 range.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Here is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n",
      "\n",
      "• Use WebSurfer to navigate to an authoritative source (e.g., bom.gov.au’s UV index page for Victoria) and retrieve today’s UV index for Melbourne.  \n",
      "• If the value isn’t readily extractable, ask WebSurfer to scrape or report the specific UV index tile/text from the page.  \n",
      "• Should direct‐page access fail or be blocked, have Coder draft a short Python script (using requests/BeautifulSoup or a BOM API if available) to pull today’s UV index, then run it via ComputerTerminal.  \n",
      "• Collect the extracted UV index value and report it back.\n",

GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS  \\n• The target language is Python.  \\n• The data source is the OpenWeatherMap API.  \\n• The script must fetch data and save it to a local file.  \\n\\n2. FACTS TO LOOK UP  \\n• Exact API endpoint(s) (e.g. current weather vs. forecast): see https://openweathermap.org/api  \\n• Required query parameters and their names (appid, q, lat, lon, units, etc.): see “API calls” section in the docs  \\n• Authentication mechanism and how to supply the API key: OpenWeatherMap documentation or developer dashboard  \\n• Rate limits and quotas: published on OpenWeatherMap’s pricing/rate‑limit page  \\n• Example JSON response structure (to know what data fields are returned): sample responses in the API docs  \\n• Python requests library usage and installation instructions: https://requests.readthedocs.io  \\n• Best practice for reading environment variables in Python (for storing the API key securely): Python’s os.getenv documentation  \\n\\n3. FACTS TO DERIVE  \\n• A sensible naming convention for the output file (e.g. including location and timestamp) based on the current datetime  \\n• The local file path where the script will write the data (current working directory vs. a subfolder)  \\n• Which part of the JSON response (full payload vs. selected fields) to persist in the file  \\n\\n4. EDUCATED GUESSES  \\n• The data will be saved as JSON (file extension “.json”).  \\n• The user will supply an environment variable (e.g. OPENWEATHER_API_KEY) rather than hard‑coding the key.  \\n• The requests library will be used for HTTP calls.  \\n• Default units will be metric unless otherwise specified.\\n\\n\\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\\n\\n• Use WebSurfer to confirm the exact OpenWeatherMap API endpoint URL, required query parameters (appid, q or lat/lon, units), and sample JSON response structure.  \\n• Ask WebSurfer for any recommended best practices around API key management (e.g. environment variables).  \\n• Have Coder draft a Python script that:  \\n  – Reads the API key (from an env var) and city or coordinates as inputs  \\n  – Makes a GET request using the requests library  \\n  – Parses the JSON response  \\n  – Constructs a timestamped filename (e.g. city_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.json)  \\n  – Writes the full JSON payload to that local file  \\n• Use FileSurfer to verify the script’s write permissions and recommend a default output directory (e.g. a “data/” subfolder).  \\n• Employ ComputerTerminal to run the final Python script end‑to‑end, fetching live data and saving it locally, then inspect the output file to confirm correct behavior.\\n', type='TextMessage'), TextMessage(source='MagenticOneOrchestrator', models_usage=None, metadata={}, content='Please look up the OpenWeatherMap current weather data API documentation.
