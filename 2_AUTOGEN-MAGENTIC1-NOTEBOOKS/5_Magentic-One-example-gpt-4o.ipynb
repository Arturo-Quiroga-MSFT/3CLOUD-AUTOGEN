    "\n",
    "Magentic-One is a generalist multi-agent system for solving open-ended web and file-based tasks across a variety of domains. It represents a significant step forward for multi-agent systems, achieving competitive performance on a number of agentic benchmarks (see the technical report for full details).\n",
    "\n",
    "When originally released in November 2024 Magentic-One was implemented directly on the autogen-core library. We have now ported Magentic-One to use autogen-agentchat, providing a more modular and easier to use interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using Magentic-One involves interacting with a digital world designed for humans, which carries inherent risks. To minimize these risks, consider the following precautions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use Containers: Run all tasks in docker containers to isolate the agents and prevent direct system attacks.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Virtual Environment: Use a virtual environment to run the agents and prevent them from accessing sensitive data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Monitor Logs: Closely monitor logs during and after execution to detect and mitigate risky behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Human Oversight: Run the examples with a human in the loop to supervise the agents and prevent unintended consequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Limit Access: Restrict the agents’ access to the internet and other resources to prevent unauthorized actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Safeguard Data: Ensure that the agents do not have access to sensitive data or resources that could be compromised. Do not share sensitive information with the agents. Be aware that agents may occasionally attempt risky actions, such as recruiting humans for help or accepting cookie agreements without human involvement. Always ensure agents are monitored and operate within a controlled environment to prevent unintended consequences. Moreover, be cautious that Magentic-One may be susceptible to prompt injection attacks from webpages."

      "  - Includes necessary labels (\\( a^2, b^2, c^2 \\)) and enhancements like color coding or annotations.  \n",
      "  - Easily relatable to the formula of the theorem using straightforward visual logic.  \n",
      "- Confirm which versions of proof diagrams (static vs. dynamic) resonate more with a general audience:  \n",
      "  - Static rearrangement diagrams vs. dynamic interactive proofs.  \n",
      "  - Examine considerations of cultural proofs or alternative geometric concepts for users seeking diversity in explanations.  \n",
      "- Establish workflow for combining textual or step-by-step explanations with diagrams to enhance clarity.  \n",
      "- Evaluate the cost-benefit tradeoff of customizing pre-made diagrams versus creating diagrams from scratch.  \n",
      "\n",
      "#### 4. EDUCATED GUESSES  \n",
      "- **Strengthened Guess 1:** Rearrangement proof diagrams showing \\( a^2 + b^2 = c^2 \\) within a large square provide the clearest visual demonstration for most users.  \n",
      "  - **Reasoning:** Widely taught and highly intuitive, this proof aligns the theorem’s geometric and algebraic components directly.  \n",
      "\n",
      "- **Strengthened Guess 2:** Pre-made diagrams from trusted academic resources will likely be the fastest solution while ensuring accuracy and clarity. Minor annotations can optimize usability and meet specific user needs.  \n",
      "  - **Reasoning:** These diagrams are often designed for educational clarity and require minimal effort for customization.  \n",
      "\n",
      "- **Strengthened Guess 3:** GeoGebra or Desmos can serve as fallback tools if pre-made diagrams lack sufficient clarity or usability.  \n",
      "  - **Reasoning:** These platforms offer adaptability for constructing precise and labeled diagrams or enhancing existing ones.  \n",
      "\n",
      "- **Strengthened Guess 4:** Color-coded annotations and labels (\\( a^2, b^2, c^2 \\)) improve diagram clarity significantly, avoiding clutter while strengthening understanding.  \n",
      "  - **Reasoning:** Colors focus user attention while linking visual elements to mathematical concepts, \\( a^2 + b^2 = c^2 \\).  \n",
      "\n",
      "- **Strengthened Guess 5:** Interactive resources (e.g., videos or dynamic diagrams) outperform static diagrams for deeper engagement and comprehension, especially with step-by-step demonstrations.  \n",
      "  - **Reasoning:** A dynamic process reinforces intuitive understanding by showcasing rearrangement phases visually, which static diagrams cannot achieve.  \n",
      "\n",
      "- **Refined Guess 6:** Tangram-style proof diagrams provide alternative perspectives but may not be intuitive in standard explanations.  \n",
      "  - **Reasoning:** While culturally significant, tangram proofs may not immediately demonstrate basic relationships (\\( a^2 + b^2 = c^2 \\)) as clearly as rearrangement diagrams.  \n",
      "\n",
      "- **Strengthened Guess 7:** Leveraging pre-made diagrams from platforms like GeoGebra saves time, especially with modification tools to meet user needs with minimal effort.  \n",
      "  - **Reasoning:** Trusted academic resources provide solid geometric accuracy, which can be enhanced with minor annotations using online platforms like GeoGebra or Desmos.  \n",
      "\n",
      "- **New Educated Guess 8:** A balance exists between delivering quickly usable pre-made diagrams and creating custom diagrams when clarity or engagement proves insufficient. Pre-made diagrams should be the first step, but fallback creation tools ensure flexibility.  \n",
      "  - **Reasoning:** Efficient workflows prioritize pre-made options but adapt as necessary depending on the user’s request or clarity gaps.  \n",
      "\n",
      "#### 5. INSIGHTS AND PRIORITIES  \n",
      "- Focus first on locating pre-made rearrangement diagrams, ensuring they are labeled and satisfying the clarity needed for proof demonstration.  \n",
      "- Annotate or modify where needed using GeoGebra or Desmos for efficiency and clarity.  \n",
      "- If pre-made diagrams are unsuitable or unusable, begin producing a custom diagram through efficient platforms (e.g., GeoGebra).  \n",
      "- Strengthen diagrams with concise textual explanations or step-by-step annotations, emphasizing direct links to the theorem formula, \\( a^2 + b^2 = c^2 \\).  \n",
      "- Reserve interactive tools (videos or dynamic proofs) for users requiring deeper engagement or additional clarity in understanding processes.  \n",
      "- Avoid time-intensive workflows or over-complicating designs; prioritize simplicity, usability, and visual connection to the theorem formula.  \n",

      "### New Additions Summary  \n",
      "1. Verified GeoGebra and Desmos as tools for efficient enhancement or creation of diagrams. Expanded their role from fallback options to customization tools for pre-made diagrams.  \n",
      "2. Added a new educated guess (#8) highlighting the tradeoff between leveraging pre-made diagrams and creating custom visual proofs based on clarity or customization needs.  \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Here is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n",
      "\n",
      "### Root Cause of Failure  \n",
      "The failure occurred because the workflow remained overly focused on refining background information, hypotheses, and fact sheets instead of executing actionable steps to locate, adapt, or create a diagram of the Pythagorean theorem. Too much time was spent discussing theoretical approaches and updates rather than solving the problem directly. Additionally, no tool was used to locate or create diagrams, which delayed tangible progress toward the task.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### New Plan  \n",
      "\n",
      "#### Actionable Steps  \n",
      "1. **Locate Pre-Made Diagram**  \n",
      "   - Perform a direct and efficient search for pre-made rearrangement proof diagrams on trusted academic platforms (e.g., MathWorld, Khan Academy, GeoGebra repositories).  \n",
      "   - Evaluate these diagrams for clarity and usability.  \n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Annotate or Enhance Diagram**  \n",
      "   - If a pre-made diagram is usable but lacks clarity (e.g., missing labels, explanations, or poor visual design), modify it using a tool like GeoGebra or Desmos.  \n",
      "   - Add necessary annotations (e.g., \\( a^2, b^2, c^2 \\)) or minimal design adjustments to maximize user comprehension.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Create Diagram If Necessary**  \n",
      "   - If no suitable pre-made diagram is found quickly (within 10 minutes max), use GeoGebra or Desmos to create a new rearrangement proof diagram from scratch.  \n",
      "   - Include essential features, such as a large square composed of \\( a^2, b^2, \\) and \\( c^2 \\), and label components clearly. Avoid over-complicated designs.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Pair Diagram With Textual Explanation**  \n",
      "   - Accompany the diagram with a concise and clear textual explanation describing how the visual elements demonstrate \\( a^2 + b^2 = c^2 \\).  \n",
      "   - Break the proof into simple logical steps (e.g., rearrangement of areas).\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Hints to Avoid Repeating Mistakes  \n",
      "- **Time Management**: Limit theoretical or exploratory preparation to 10-15 minutes. Switch to execution tasks (locating, modifying, or creating diagrams) immediately after this period.  \n",
      "- **Progress Over Perfection**: Focus on delivering a straightforward, functional diagram and explanation instead of continuously refining planning steps.  \n",
      "- **Use Tools Early**: Employ GeoGebra or Desmos immediately if pre-made diagrams are insufficient, avoiding further delays.  \n",
      "- **Minimize Complexity**: Keep diagrams simple, accessible, and intuitive, avoiding unnecessary distractions or overly decorative elements.  \n",
      "- **Avoid Overthinking**: Stick to actionable tasks instead of revising hypotheses or fact sheets unnecessarily.  \n",
      "\n",

      "- The request specifies the UV index in Melbourne for \"today.\"  \n",
      "- No other specific facts or figures are provided directly in the request.  \n",
      "\n",
      "### 2. FACTS TO LOOK UP  \n",
      "- The current UV index for Melbourne today. This information may need to be sourced from reputable meteorological or environmental websites, such as:  \n",
      "  - The Australian Bureau of Meteorology (BOM)  \n",
      "  - The World Weather Online service  \n",
      "  - Other real-time weather applications or services that provide UV index information.  \n",
      "\n",
      "### 3. FACTS TO DERIVE  \n",
      "- Time zone adjustments or clarification regarding the current date in Melbourne, as it may differ depending on the requester’s location or time zone.  \n",
      "\n",
      "### 4. EDUCATED GUESSES  \n",
      "- Based on knowledge of Melbourne's climate, the UV index is usually moderate to high during its summer months, frequently exceeding levels of 6 or higher (categorized as \"high\" to \"very high\"). If the current season is summer (December to February in the Southern Hemisphere), the index is likely elevated.  \n",
      "- If today occurs during late autumn or winter, the UV index in Melbourne would generally be lower, potentially in the \"low\" category (e.g., below 3). However, Australia’s location relative to the ozone layer means UV radiation can remain significant year-round.  \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Here is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n",
      "\n",
      "Here’s the concise bullet-point plan for addressing the original request:\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Step 1**: Ask *WebSurfer* to search for the current UV index in Melbourne today using reputable sources like the Australian Bureau of Meteorology or other reliable weather services. \n",
      "- **Step 2**: If needed, request WebSurfer to clarify Melbourne’s local date and time to ensure the UV index corresponds to \"today.\"\n",
      "- **Step 3**: Summarize the findings and confirm the accuracy of the provided UV index.\n",
      "\n",
      "Notes: Only *WebSurfer* is required for this task, as it involves retrieving real-time data from external sources. No coding, simulation, or local files are needed.\n",
      "\n",
      "---------- TextMessage (MagenticOneOrchestrator) ----------\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "To answer this request we have assembled the following team:\n",
      "\n",
      "FileSurfer: An agent that can handle local files.\n",
      "WebSurfer: A helpful assistant with access to a web browser. Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Here is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n",
      "\n",
      "### 1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\n",
      "- The request asks for a Python script to interact with the **OpenWeatherMap API**.  \n",
      "- The script must **fetch data** from this API.  \n",
      "- The script must also **save the fetched data locally**.  \n",
      "\n",
      "### 2. FACTS TO LOOK UP\n",
      "- **OpenWeatherMap API documentation**: Specific details about the API (e.g., endpoints, query parameters, response format) need to be verified. This information can be found directly on the official OpenWeatherMap API documentation at [https://openweathermap.org/api](https://openweathermap.org/api).  \n",
      "- Whether **authentication** or an API key is required to access OpenWeatherMap API data. Typically such services require an API key, but this would need confirming in the official documentation.  \n",
      "- Recommended format for locally saving API data (e.g., JSON, CSV, or other file types). Although JSON is common, OpenWeatherMap's output format options need to be checked.  \n",
      "\n",
      "### 3. FACTS TO DERIVE\n",
      "- Based on the request, the Python script will need a way to handle **HTTP requests** (e.g., using `requests` or `http.client` libraries).  \n",
      "- Logical deduction reveals potential steps required in the script, such as:  \n",
      "    - Sending a request to the API to fetch weather data.  \n",
      "    - Parsing and handling the API's response.  \n",
      "    - Writing the fetched data into a file stored locally.  \n",
      "\n",
      "### 4. EDUCATED GUESSES\n",
      "- OpenWeatherMap likely requires a **free or paid API key** since most weather APIs are not open-access.  \n",
      "- OpenWeatherMap data is likely returned in **JSON** format, as JSON is standard for API responses.  \n",
      "- A widely-used library like **`requests`** will likely be the easiest way to fetch data for this task in Python.  \n",
      "- Locally saving the file could involve using Python's **`open()`** function to write the fetched data to a file (e.g., as `data.json`).  \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Here is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n",
      "\n",
      "### Bullet-Point Plan\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **WebSurfer**:\n",
      "   - Search for and locate the official OpenWeatherMap API documentation at [https://openweathermap.org/api](https://openweathermap.org/api). \n",
      "   - Confirm the required API endpoint for fetching weather data.\n",
      "   - Check if an API key is mandatory and confirm the steps to obtain one. Gather details on the response format (e.g., JSON) and optional query parameters (e.g., location, units, etc.).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Coder**:\n",
      "   - Draft a Python script to:\n",
      "     - Make a request to the OpenWeatherMap API using the endpoint and parameters from WebSurfer's findings.\n",
      "     - Retrieve weather data and handle the API response.\n",
      "     - Save the retrieved data locally in an appropriate format (e.g., JSON).\n",
      "   - Optimize the script for general use (such as adding comments, making it dynamic for different inputs like city names, etc.).\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **FileSurfer**:\n",
      "   - Verify that the locally saved file contains the fetched data and confirm its format and accessibility.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **ComputerTerminal**:\n",
      "   - Test the Python script by running it to ensure it successfully fetches weather data, processes it, and saves it locally without errors. Debug if needed.  \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, filling in form fields, etc.). It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the page seems not yet fully loaded.\\nCoder: A helpful and general-purpose AI assistant that has strong language skills, Python skills, and Linux command line skills.\\nComputerTerminal: A computer terminal that performs no other action than running Python scripts (provided to it quoted in ```python code blocks), or sh shell scripts (provided to it quoted in ```sh code blocks).\\n\\n\\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\\n\\n### 1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\\n- The request asks for a Python script to interact with the **OpenWeatherMap API**.  \\n- The script must **fetch data** from this API.  \\n- The script must also **save the fetched data locally**.  \\n\\n### 2. FACTS TO LOOK UP\\n- **OpenWeatherMap API documentation**: Specific details about the API (e.g., endpoints, query parameters, response format) need to be verified. This information can be found directly on the official OpenWeatherMap API documentation at [https://openweathermap.org/api](https://openweathermap.org/api).  \\n- Whether **authentication** or an API key is required to access OpenWeatherMap API data. Typically such services require an API key, but this would need confirming in the official documentation.  \\n- Recommended format for locally saving API data (e.g., JSON, CSV, or other file types). Although JSON is common, OpenWeatherMap's output format options need to be checked.  \\n\\n### 3. FACTS TO DERIVE\\n- Based on the request, the Python script will need a way to handle **HTTP requests** (e.g., using `requests` or `http.client` libraries).  \\n- Logical deduction reveals potential steps required in the script, such as:  \\n    - Sending a request to the API to fetch weather data.  \\n    - Parsing and handling the API's response.  \\n    - Writing the fetched data into a file stored locally.  \\n\\n### 4. EDUCATED GUESSES\\n- OpenWeatherMap likely requires a **free or paid API key** since most weather APIs are not open-access.  \\n- OpenWeatherMap data is likely returned in **JSON** format, as JSON is standard for API responses.  \\n- A widely-used library like **`requests`** will likely be the easiest way to fetch data for this task in Python.  \\n- Locally saving the file could involve using Python's **`open()`** function to write the fetched data to a file (e.g., as `data.json`).  \\n\\n\\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\\n\\n### Bullet-Point Plan\\n\\n1. **WebSurfer**:\\n   - Search for and locate the official OpenWeatherMap API documentation at [https://openweathermap.org/api](https://openweathermap.org/api). \\n   - Confirm the required API endpoint for fetching weather data.\\n   - Check if an API key is mandatory and confirm the steps to obtain one. Gather details on the response format (e.g., JSON) and optional query parameters (e.g., location, units, etc.).\\n\\n2. **Coder**:\\n   - Draft a Python script to:\\n     - Make a request to the OpenWeatherMap API using the endpoint and parameters from WebSurfer's findings.\\n     - Retrieve weather data and handle the API response.\\n     - Save the retrieved data locally in an appropriate format (e.g., JSON).\\n   - Optimize the script for general use (such as adding comments, making it dynamic for different inputs like city names, etc.).\\n\\n3. **FileSurfer**:\\n   - Verify that the locally saved file contains the fetched data and confirm its format and accessibility.\\n\\n4. **ComputerTerminal**:\\n   - Test the Python script by running it to ensure it successfully fetches weather data, processes it, and saves it locally without errors. Debug if needed.  \\n\\n\\n\", type='TextMessage'), TextMessage(source='MagenticOneOrchestrator', models_usage=None, metadata={}, content='Please search for the OpenWeatherMap API documentation and gather the following details: 1) The endpoint to fetch weather data; 2) Authentication requirements (e.g., API key); 3) Response format (e.g., JSON, XML); 4) Available query parameters (e.g., location, units); and any other necessary information.', type='TextMessage'), MultiModalMessage(source='WebSurfer', models_usage=RequestUsage(prompt_tokens=3140, completion_tokens=44), metadata={}, content=['I typed \\'OpenWeatherMap API documentation endpoint authentication response format\\' into \\'0 characters out of 2000\\'.\\n\\nThe web browser is open to the page [OpenWeatherMap API documentation endpoint authentication response format - Search](https://www.bing.com/search?q=OpenWeatherMap+API+documentation+endpoint+authentication+response+format&form=QBLH&sp=-1&lq=0&pq=&sc=0-0&qs=n&sk=&cvid=8B368365AC844B58802274FD828B3286).\\nThe viewport shows 24% of the webpage, and is positioned at the top of the page\\nThe following text is visible in the viewport:\\n\\nBy using this site you agree to the use of cookies for analytics, personalized content, and ads.\\nLearn more about third party cookies\\n|\\nMicrosoft Privacy Policy \\nSkip to content\\nOpenWeatherMap API documentation endpoint authentication response formatFrançais3\\nAll\\nSearch\\nCopilot\\nVideos\\nImages\\nMaps\\nNews\\nFilters\\nAbout 424,000 resultsDetermines the \\nformat of the \\nresponse.
