# LangChain’s Explosive Growth: A Look at Monthly Downloads

## Introduction
LangChain is an increasingly popular framework that simplifies building applications around large language models (LLMs). Its modular approach, extensive documentation, and well-maintained set of tools help developers quickly integrate LLMs into production-ready environments—making it a go-to choice for developers seeking to leverage GPT-like models in complex workflows.

## What is LangChain?
LangChain helps you manage prompts, memory, and multiple model providers in a unified pipeline. It abstracts away the intricacies of calling different LLM APIs, storing conversation states, caching responses, and more. In essence, it makes AI model usage less about “low-level plumbing” and more about building meaningful solutions.
