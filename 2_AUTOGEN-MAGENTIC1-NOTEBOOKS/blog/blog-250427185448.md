# Machine Learning: Definition, AI vs ML, and a Brief History

## 1. What Is Machine Learning?  
Machine Learning (ML) is a subfield of Artificial Intelligence (AI) focused on building systems that learn from data and improve over time without being explicitly programmed. Instead of hard‑coding rules (“if A then B”), ML algorithms infer patterns and decision rules by analyzing large datasets. 

Key types of ML include:  
- **Supervised Learning**: Models train on labeled data (input–output pairs) to predict unseen outputs.  
- **Unsupervised Learning**: Models find hidden structures in unlabeled data (e.g., clustering customers by behavior).  
- **Semi‑supervised Learning**: Combines a small amount of labeled data with large unlabeled datasets to improve learning accuracy.  
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Agents learn optimal actions via trial and error, receiving rewards or penalties from their environment.

ML powers applications such as recommendation systems (Netflix, Amazon), image and speech recognition, fraud detection, and personalized medicine.

## 2. AI vs. ML: What’s the Difference?  
Although often used interchangeably, AI and ML describe different scopes:

- **Artificial Intelligence**  
  • Broad field aiming to build machines capable of “intelligent” behavior.  
  • Encompasses logic, expert systems, planning, robotics, natural language processing, and more.

- **Machine Learning**  
  • A subset of AI focused specifically on algorithms that learn patterns from data.  
  • Relies on statistical techniques to make predictions or decisions.

In short: all ML is AI, but not all AI uses ML. Traditional AI might use rule‑based or logic‑driven approaches, whereas ML centers on data‑driven model induction.

## 3. A Brief History of Machine Learning  
1. **1950s–1960s: Early Days**  
   - Alan Turing’s 1950 paper “Computing Machinery and Intelligence” asked “Can machines think?”  
   - The first perceptron (an early neural network) was proposed by Frank Rosenblatt in 1957.

2. **1970s–1980s: Symbolic AI & Expert Systems**  
   - Research shifted toward rule‑based expert systems (e.g., MYCIN for medical diagnosis).  
   - Interest in neural networks waned until the backpropagation algorithm revived them in 1986.

3. **1990s–2000s: Statistical Learning**  
   - Support Vector Machines (1995) and ensemble methods like Random Forests (2001) gained popularity.  
   - The internet boom provided massive datasets, fueling data‑driven approaches.

4. **2010s–Present: Deep Learning & Big Data**  
   - Deep neural networks (e.g., AlexNet in 2012) dramatically improved image and speech recognition.  
   - Advances in GPUs, cloud computing, and open‑source frameworks (TensorFlow, PyTorch) democratized ML.  
   - Today, ML is ubiquitous—from self‑driving cars to real‑time language translation.
