      "### Literature Review: No-Code Tools for Building Multi-Agent AI Systems\n",
      "\n",
      "The development and deployment of multi-agent AI systems (MAS) have traditionally required significant expertise in programming, AI model orchestration, and debugging. However, the emergence of no-code platforms is revolutionizing this landscape, enabling users with limited technical proficiency to design, implement, and manage MAS. This literature review synthesizes the current state of research and development in no-code tools for building multi-agent AI systems.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 1. The Role of No-Code Platforms in Multi-Agent Systems\n",
      "No-code platforms aim to lower the barriers to AI adoption by abstracting the complexities of programming and system orchestration. By leveraging graphical user interfaces, declarative specifications, and pre-built components, these platforms empower users to create MAS without writing code. This democratization is crucial for organizations and individuals lacking deep technical expertise but seeking to harness the power of advanced AI systems.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jeong (2025) provides a comprehensive overview of how no-code platforms can address practical constraints and entry barriers associated with AI adoption. By enabling users to build and manage MAS through intuitive interfaces, these systems allow for multifaceted applications such as code generation from image-based notes, question-answering systems, and multimedia content creation. The study emphasizes that no-code platforms not only enhance accessibility but also promote scalability and efficiency in AI-driven workflows (Jeong, 2025).\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 2. Key Features of No-Code Multi-Agent AI Development Tools\n",
      "Modern no-code tools integrate advanced functionalities to support the design and deployment of multi-agent systems. These features typically include:\n",
      "- **Declarative Workflow Specification**: Tools like AutoGen Studio provide JSON-based specifications for defining agent workflows. This approach simplifies the complex task of orchestrating AI agents and tools (Dibia et al., 2024).\n",
      "- **Drag-and-Drop Interfaces**: Intuitive graphical interfaces allow users to design workflows visually, reducing the cognitive load associated with programming (Dibia et al., 2024).\n",
      "- **Reusable Components**: Libraries of pre-built agent components enable rapid prototyping and reuse of functional modules (Dibia et al., 2024).\n",
      "- **Interactive Debugging**: Real-time evaluation and debugging tools help users refine workflows by providing immediate feedback on system behavior (Dibia et al., 2024).\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 3. Applications of No-Code Multi-Agent Systems\n",
      "The versatility of no-code platforms has enabled a wide range of applications in both business and creative domains. For instance:\n",
      "- **Generative AI Applications**: Tools like Prompt Sapper allow users to compose prompt-based AI services for tasks such as natural language processing, image generation, and complex reasoning. This integration of software engineering principles into AI chain development improves the quality and performance of AI services (Cheng et al., 2023).\n",
      "- **Enterprise Use Cases**: No-code MAS platforms support business-specific needs, including compliance checking, workflow automation, and workforce training. These systems streamline operations and enhance productivity while reducing technical overhead (Wan et al., 2024).\n",
      "- **Collaborative Problem Solving**: Multi-agent systems facilitate long-running, complex tasks by enabling multiple AI agents to collaborate. For example, AutoGen Studio supports the design of collaborative AI workflows for domains such as customer service and content generation (Dibia et al., 2024).\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 4. Challenges and Future Directions\n",
      "Despite their potential, no-code platforms face several challenges:\n",
      "- **Trust and Usability**: Developers often struggle to trust AI tools due to a lack of transparency in model mechanisms. Enhancing user trust requires tools to communicate AI performance effectively and provide mechanisms for validating AI outputs (Wang et al., 2023).\n",
      "- **Scalability and Adaptability**: While no-code platforms are effective for prototyping, scaling these systems for enterprise-level deployment remains a challenge. Future research should explore how to optimize these platforms for larger and more complex use cases (Jeong, 2025).\n",
      "- **Interoperability**: Ensuring seamless integration with existing systems and workflows is critical for the widespread adoption of no-code MAS tools (Cheng et al., 2023).\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 5. Conclusion\n",
      "No-code tools for building multi-agent AI systems represent a transformative shift in the field of AI development. By lowering technical barriers, these platforms empower a broader range of users to leverage AI technologies effectively. Research efforts such as those by Dibia et al. (2024), Jeong (2025), and Cheng et al. (2023) underscore the potential of no-code MAS platforms to democratize AI and enhance productivity across various domains. However, addressing challenges related to trust, scalability, and interoperability will be crucial for the continued evolution of these tools.\n",
