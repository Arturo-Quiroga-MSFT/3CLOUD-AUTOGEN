    "## Magentic One Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Magentic-One is a generalist multi-agent system for solving open-ended web and file-based tasks across a variety of domains. It represents a significant step forward for multi-agent systems, achieving competitive performance on a number of agentic benchmarks (see the technical report for full details).\n",
    "\n",
    "When originally released in November 2024 Magentic-One was implemented directly on the autogen-core library. We have now ported Magentic-One to use autogen-agentchat, providing a more modular and easier to use interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using Magentic-One involves interacting with a digital world designed for humans, which carries inherent risks. To minimize these risks, consider the following precautions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use Containers: Run all tasks in docker containers to isolate the agents and prevent direct system attacks.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Virtual Environment: Use a virtual environment to run the agents and prevent them from accessing sensitive data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Monitor Logs: Closely monitor logs during and after execution to detect and mitigate risky behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Human Oversight: Run the examples with a human in the loop to supervise the agents and prevent unintended consequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Limit Access: Restrict the agents’ access to the internet and other resources to prevent unauthorized actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Safeguard Data: Ensure that the agents do not have access to sensitive data or resources that could be compromised. Do not share sensitive information with the agents. Be aware that agents may occasionally attempt risky actions, such as recruiting humans for help or accepting cookie agreements without human involvement. Always ensure agents are monitored and operate within a controlled environment to prevent unintended consequences. Moreover, be cautious that Magentic-One may be susceptible to prompt injection attacks from webpages."

      "- The user wants a Python script.  \n",
      "- The script must fetch data from the OpenWeatherMap API.  \n",
      "- The script must save the fetched data to a local file.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. FACTS TO LOOK UP  \n",
      "- The exact OpenWeatherMap API endpoint(s) (e.g., current weather data URL).  \n",
      "- The required query parameters and their formats (e.g., `appid`, `q` or `lat`/`lon`).  \n",
      "- The base URL: typically `https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather`.  \n",
      "- Authentication details (how to register for and include an API key).  \n",
      "- Best practices for local file paths in Python (e.g., using `os` or `pathlib`).\n",
      "\n",
      "3. FACTS TO DERIVE  \n",
      "- How to structure the HTTP request in Python (likely via the `requests` library).  \n",
      "- How to handle errors or non‑200 HTTP responses.  \n",
      "- How to serialize the API response (JSON) and write it to disk.  \n",
      "- Reasonable defaults for filename, encoding, and file format (e.g., `.json`).\n",
      "\n",
      "4. EDUCATED GUESSES  \n",
      "- The user will supply or obtain their own OpenWeatherMap API key.  \n",
      "- The data will be saved in JSON format.  \n",
      "- The script will use standard libraries (`requests`, `json`, `os` or `pathlib`).  \n",
      "- A simple command‑line interface (e.g., passing city name or coordinates) may be desired.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Here is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n",
      "\n",
      "- WebSurfer: look up and summarize the current OpenWeatherMap API endpoint, required query parameters (API key, city name or coordinates), and response format.  \n",
      "- Coder: draft a Python script that  \n",
      "  • reads user inputs (city or coords + API key)  \n",
      "  • uses `requests` to fetch the API data  \n",
      "  • handles errors (non‑200 responses)  \n",
      "  • writes the JSON payload to a local file (e.g. `weather.json`, using `pathlib` for paths).  \n",
      "- ComputerTerminal: install any needed Python dependencies (e.g. `requests`), run the script with sample inputs, and verify it produces the expected file.  \n",

GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS  \\n- The user wants a Python script.  \\n- The script must fetch data from the OpenWeatherMap API.  \\n- The script must save the fetched data to a local file.\\n\\n2. FACTS TO LOOK UP  \\n- The exact OpenWeatherMap API endpoint(s) (e.g., current weather data URL).  \\n- The required query parameters and their formats (e.g., `appid`, `q` or `lat`/`lon`).  \\n- The base URL: typically `https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather`.  \\n- Authentication details (how to register for and include an API key).  \\n- Best practices for local file paths in Python (e.g., using `os` or `pathlib`).\\n\\n3. FACTS TO DERIVE  \\n- How to structure the HTTP request in Python (likely via the `requests` library).  \\n- How to handle errors or non‑200 HTTP responses.  \\n- How to serialize the API response (JSON) and write it to disk.  \\n- Reasonable defaults for filename, encoding, and file format (e.g., `.json`).\\n\\n4. EDUCATED GUESSES  \\n- The user will supply or obtain their own OpenWeatherMap API key.  \\n- The data will be saved in JSON format.  \\n- The script will use standard libraries (`requests`, `json`, `os` or `pathlib`).  \\n- A simple command‑line interface (e.g., passing city name or coordinates) may be desired.\\n\\n\\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\\n\\n- WebSurfer: look up and summarize the current OpenWeatherMap API endpoint, required query parameters (API key, city name or coordinates), and response format.  \\n- Coder: draft a Python script that  \\n  • reads user inputs (city or coords + API key)  \\n  • uses `requests` to fetch the API data  \\n  • handles errors (non‑200 responses)  \\n  • writes the JSON payload to a local file (e.g. `weather.json`, using `pathlib` for paths).  \\n- ComputerTerminal: install any needed Python dependencies (e.g. `requests`), run the script with sample inputs, and verify it produces the expected file.  \\n- FileSurfer (optional): inspect the saved file to confirm its contents match the fetched JSON schema.\\n', type='TextMessage'), TextMessage(source='MagenticOneOrchestrator', models_usage=None, metadata={}, content='Please find and summarize the OpenWeatherMap current weather API documentation: the base URL, required query parameters (e.g., appid, q or lat/lon), response format, and any authentication details.', type='TextMessage'), MultiModalMessage(source='WebSurfer', models_usage=RequestUsage(prompt_tokens=2027, completion_tokens=241), metadata={}, content=['I typed \\'OpenWeatherMap current weather API documentation base URL appid q lat lon response format\\' into the browser search bar.\\n\\nThe web browser is open to the page [OpenWeatherMap current weather API documentation base URL appid q lat lon response format - Search](https://www.bing.com/search?q=OpenWeatherMap+current+weather+API+documentation+base+URL+appid+q+lat+lon+response+format&FORM=QBLH).\\nThe viewport shows 26% of the webpage, and is positioned at the top of the page\\nThe following text is visible in the viewport:\\n\\nBy using this site you agree to the use of cookies for analytics, personalized content, and ads.\\nLearn more about third party cookies\\n|\\nMicrosoft Privacy Policy \\nSkip to content\\nOpenWeatherMap current weather API documentation base URL appid q lat lon response formatFrançaisMobileAll\\nSearch\\nCopilot\\nVideos\\nImages\\nMaps\\nNews\\nMore\\nTools\\nOpenWeatherMap\\nhttps://openweathermap.org › currentCurrent weather data - OpenWeatherMapObtain real-time \\nweather data for any location globally with \\nOpenWeather\\'\\ns \\nCurrent \\nWeather Data \\nAPI.
