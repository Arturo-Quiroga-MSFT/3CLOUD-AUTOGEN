      "### **Language & Communication Tips for Nepal:**\n",
      "1. **National Language:** Nepali is the official language of Nepal. While English is widely spoken in tourist areas like Kathmandu, Bhaktapur, and Nagarkot, knowing a few basic Nepali phrases can be helpful and appreciated by locals:\n",
      "   - **Namaste:** Hello or greetings (used universally in Nepal).  \n",
      "   - **Dhanyabad:** Thank you.  \n",
      "   - **Kripaya:** Please.  \n",
      "   - **Kaha cha?:** Where is...?  \n",
      "   - **Pani:** Water.  \n",
      "   - **Tapaiko naam k ho?:** What is your name?  \n",
      "\n",
      "2. **English Proficiency:** Many people working in the tourism industry (hoteliers, guides, shopkeepers, etc.) speak decent English, so you'll be able to communicate effectively in most places, especially in Thamel and tourist hubs. \n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Offline Translation Apps:** Download translation apps like Google Translate for Nepali. Consider downloading offline language packs since connectivity can be spotty, particularly in hill stations like Nagarkot.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Body Language & Gesture:** Nepalese people are warm and welcoming. A smile and polite gestures go a long way, especially when language barriers exist.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Signage:** Tourist destinations often have bilingual signs (Nepali and English), making navigation relatively easy. However, in rural areas or less-touristed spots, signs might be only in Nepali.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### **Feedback on Your Plan:**\n",
      "Your itinerary is well-planned and incorporates key destinations and cultural highlights. It’s also satisfactory in terms of language considerations, as most of the locations you'll visit are English-friendly. However, adding basic Nepali phrases for greetings and expressions would enhance your experience and build rapport with locals.\n",
