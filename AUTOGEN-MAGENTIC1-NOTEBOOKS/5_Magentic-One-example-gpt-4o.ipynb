    "\n",
    "Magentic-One is a generalist multi-agent system for solving open-ended web and file-based tasks across a variety of domains. It represents a significant step forward for multi-agent systems, achieving competitive performance on a number of agentic benchmarks (see the technical report for full details).\n",
    "\n",
    "When originally released in November 2024 Magentic-One was implemented directly on the autogen-core library. We have now ported Magentic-One to use autogen-agentchat, providing a more modular and easier to use interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using Magentic-One involves interacting with a digital world designed for humans, which carries inherent risks. To minimize these risks, consider the following precautions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use Containers: Run all tasks in docker containers to isolate the agents and prevent direct system attacks.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Virtual Environment: Use a virtual environment to run the agents and prevent them from accessing sensitive data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Monitor Logs: Closely monitor logs during and after execution to detect and mitigate risky behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Human Oversight: Run the examples with a human in the loop to supervise the agents and prevent unintended consequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Limit Access: Restrict the agentsâ€™ access to the internet and other resources to prevent unauthorized actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Safeguard Data: Ensure that the agents do not have access to sensitive data or resources that could be compromised. Do not share sensitive information with the agents. Be aware that agents may occasionally attempt risky actions, such as recruiting humans for help or accepting cookie agreements without human involvement. Always ensure agents are monitored and operate within a controlled environment to prevent unintended consequences. Moreover, be cautious that Magentic-One may be susceptible to prompt injection attacks from webpages."

      "Andrew Wiles' proof of Fermat's Last Theorem is based on a deep connection between number theory and algebraic geometry, specifically the theory of modular forms and elliptic curves. Here is a summary of his proof and historical attempts:\n",
      "\n",
      "### Andrew Wiles' Proof\n",
      "1. **Modular Forms and Elliptic Curves**:\n",
      "   - Wiles' proof relies on the Taniyama-Shimura-Weil conjecture (now known as the modularity theorem), which states that every elliptic curve over the rational numbers is associated with a modular form.\n",
      "   - Fermat's Last Theorem is linked to this conjecture through the Frey curve, an elliptic curve constructed from a hypothetical solution to \\(a^n + b^n = c^n\\) for \\(n > 2\\).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Frey Curve and Contradiction**:\n",
      "   - If \\(a^n + b^n = c^n\\) had a solution, the associated Frey curve would have unusual properties that contradict the modularity theorem.\n",
      "   - Wiles proved the modularity theorem for a specific class of elliptic curves, which included the Frey curve, thereby ruling out the possibility of solutions to Fermat's equation.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Techniques Used**:\n",
      "   - Wiles employed advanced tools from algebraic geometry, including Galois representations and deformation theory.\n",
      "   - He worked with his collaborator Richard Taylor to address gaps in the initial proof, completing it in 1994.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Historical Attempts\n",
      "1. **Euler**:\n",
      "   - Euler proved Fermat's Last Theorem for \\(n = 3\\) using techniques from algebra and number theory.\n",
      "   - His approach involved factoring the equation \\(a^3 + b^3 = c^3\\) into complex numbers and analyzing their properties.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Sophie Germain**:\n",
      "   - Germain made significant progress by proving the theorem for a large class of prime exponents \\(n\\).\n",
      "   - She introduced the concept of \"auxiliary primes\" and showed that if certain conditions were met, no solutions could exist.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Other Mathematicians**:\n",
      "   - Over the centuries, mathematicians like Dirichlet and Legendre extended Fermat's Last Theorem to specific cases and classes of exponents.\n",
      "   - Partial results accumulated, but a general proof remained elusive until Wiles' work.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Insights for Alternative Approaches\n",
      "- Historical attempts often relied on elementary number theory and algebraic techniques, which proved insufficient for the general case.\n",
      "- Wiles' proof demonstrated that modern tools like modular forms and elliptic curves were essential for tackling the theorem comprehensively.\n",

      "\n",
      "#### 1. **Topology**\n",
      "Topology studies properties of spaces that are preserved under continuous deformations. While topology has been instrumental in solving problems in geometry and analysis, its direct application to Fermat's Last Theorem is less clear. However, some connections exist:\n",
      "   - **Homotopy and Algebraic Topology**: These tools have been used to study the structure of algebraic varieties, which are closely related to elliptic curves and modular forms.\n",
      "   - **Topological Invariants**: These could theoretically be used to analyze the properties of solutions to \\(a^n + b^n = c^n\\), but no known topological approach has been developed to address Fermat's Last Theorem directly.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 2. **Combinatorics**\n",
      "Combinatorics deals with counting, arrangement, and optimization problems. While it is a powerful tool in discrete mathematics, its applicability to Fermat's Last Theorem is limited:\n",
      "   - **Partition Theory**: This could be used to analyze the distribution of integers satisfying certain modular conditions, but it does not directly address the equation \\(a^n + b^n = c^n\\).\n",
      "   - **Graph Theory**: Representing integer solutions as nodes and their relationships as edges might provide insights, but this approach has not been explored in depth for Fermat's Last Theorem.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 3. **Computational Algebra**\n",
      "Computational algebra involves using algorithms and computer simulations to solve algebraic problems. This field has potential for exploring Fermat's Last Theorem:\n",
      "   - **Symbolic Computation**: Tools like Mathematica or SageMath can verify specific cases or explore patterns in solutions.\n",
      "   - **Algorithmic Number Theory**: Algorithms for factorization, modular arithmetic, and elliptic curve analysis could provide insights into the structure of potential solutions.\n",
      "   - **Experimental Mathematics**: Computational experiments might reveal new patterns or conjectures related to the theorem.\n",

The proof relies on the modularity theorem, which links elliptic curves to modular forms, and uses tools from algebraic geometry and Galois theory. This suggests that any alternative proof would likely need to engage with similarly sophisticated mathematical frameworks.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 2. **Historical Attempts**\n",
      "Historical attempts by Euler, Sophie Germain, and others relied on elementary number theory and algebraic techniques. While these efforts provided partial results for specific cases (e.g., \\(n = 3\\), certain prime exponents), they were insufficient for the general case. The failure of elementary methods over centuries indicates that simpler approaches are unlikely to succeed.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 3. **Modern Mathematical Tools**\n",
      "Exploration of modern tools like topology, combinatorics, and computational algebra revealed the following:\n",
      "   - **Topology**: While topology offers powerful tools for analyzing spaces and structures, its direct application to Fermat's Last Theorem remains speculative and would require significant theoretical development.\n",

However, computational methods alone are unlikely to produce a rigorous proof without theoretical breakthroughs.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Proposed Direction for an Alternative Proof\n",
      "Given the findings, a concrete direction for constructing an alternative proof could involve:\n",
      "1. **Exploring New Connections**:\n",
      "   - Investigate whether other mathematical frameworks (e.g., topology, higher-dimensional geometry, or category theory) could provide new insights into the structure of solutions to \\(a^n + b^n = c^n\\).\n",

      "- The UV index in Toronto tends to be higher during clear, sunny days and lower during overcast or rainy conditions.\n",

      "- **Step 3**: Verify that the information provided is current and matches today's date.  \n",

      "- The format of the data returned by the API (e.g., JSON, XML).\n",
      "- Whether authentication is required, and if so, the process for obtaining an API key (likely found on the OpenWeatherMap official documentation).\n",

      "  - Necessary libraries for API requests (e.g., `requests` module).\n",
      "  - Libraries for handling and saving data locally (e.g., `json`, `os`, etc.).\n",
      "- Error handling and logging mechanisms for API failures or file-saving issues.\n",

      "- The OpenWeatherMap API likely requires an API key for authentication, based on standard practices for similar services.\n",
      "- The data returned from OpenWeatherMap is probably in JSON format, as this is common for modern APIs.\n",
      "- File-saving could involve naming conventions (e.g., timestamp-based filenames) to prevent overwriting existing data.\n",

      "3. **FileSurfer**:\n",

EDUCATED GUESSES\\n- The OpenWeatherMap API likely requires an API key for authentication, based on standard practices for similar services.\\n- The data returned from OpenWeatherMap is probably in JSON format, as this is common for modern APIs.\\n- File-saving could involve naming conventions (e.g., timestamp-based filenames) to prevent overwriting existing data.\\n- The script might need to handle rate limits imposed by the OpenWeatherMap API.\\n\\n\\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\\n\\n### Plan for Addressing the Request\\n\\n1. **WebSurfer**:\\n   - Search for the OpenWeatherMap API documentation to find:\\n     - The correct API endpoint for fetching weather data.\\n     - Authentication requirements (e.g., how to obtain an API key).\\n     - Data format (likely JSON) and any specific parameters required for the API request.\\n     - Rate limits or other restrictions.\\n\\n2. **Coder**:\\n   - Write the Python script based on the information retrieved by WebSurfer:\\n     - Include functionality for sending requests to the OpenWeatherMap API.\\n     - Parse the returned data (likely JSON).\\n     - Save the data locally in a suitable format (e.g., JSON file).\\n     - Implement error handling for API failures, rate limits, or file-writing issues.\\n\\n3. **FileSurfer**:\\n   - Verify that the file is saved locally as expected (e.g., check file existence and file content structure).\\n\\n4. **ComputerTerminal**:\\n   - Run the Python script to ensure it works as intended:\\n     - Test the script for fetching data from the API and saving it locally.\\n     - Confirm no runtime errors or issues.\\n\\n5. **Final Validation**:\\n   - Ensure the saved file can be opened and read properly.\\n   - Confirm that the data fetched matches the expected output from the OpenWeatherMap API.\\n\", type='TextMessage'), TextMessage(source='MagenticOneOrchestrator', models_usage=None, metadata={}, content='Search for the OpenWeatherMap API documentation and find details about the API endpoint, authentication process, data format, and any limitations (e.g., rate limits).', type='TextMessage'), MultiModalMessage(source='WebSurfer', models_usage=RequestUsage(prompt_tokens=3036, completion_tokens=44), metadata={}, content=['I typed \\'OpenWeatherMap API documentation\\' into \\'0 characters out of 2000\\'.\\n\\nThe web browser is open to the page [OpenWeatherMap API documentation - Search](https://www.bing.com/search?q=OpenWeatherMap+API+documentation&form=QBLH&sp=-1&lq=0&pq=&sc=0-0&qs=n&sk=&cvid=D52D64F1205C4A64963329FBE80C2675).\\nThe viewport shows 24% of the webpage, and is positioned at the top of the page\\nThe following text is visible in the viewport:\\n\\nBy using this site you agree to the use of cookies for analytics, personalized content, and ads.\\nLearn more about third party cookies\\n|\\nMicrosoft Privacy Policy \\nSkip to content\\nOpenWeatherMap API documentationFranÃ§aisMobileAll\\nSearch\\nVideos\\nImages\\nMaps\\nNews\\nCopilot\\nMore\\nTools\\nCopilot Answer\\nOpenWeatherMap\\nhttps://\\nopenweathermap.org/\\napiWeather API - OpenWeatherMap\\nLearn how to use\\n OpenWeatherMap APIs to access current, forecast, historical, and statistical weather data for any location on the globe.
